  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">At Aurea Bliss, we aim to provide products that meet your expectations, but we understand that sometimes returns are necessary.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Cancellation Policy</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">If you wish to cancel your order, please do so within a 3-hour window after placing your order. Once our fulfillment team begins processing the order, cancellations can no longer be facilitated.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Return Policy</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">Your satisfaction is of utmost importance to us. If you're not content with your Aurea Bliss purchase, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@aureabliss.com" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: none;">info@aureabliss.com</a> within 30 days from the date of delivery to initiate a return or exchange. To qualify for a return, items must be unused, undamaged, and in their original packaging.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Replacement Policy</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">For orders under our Insured Shipping and Handling tier, if you receive a defective, damaged, or incorrect item, please provide us with photo or video evidence at <a href="mailto:info@aureabliss.com" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: none;">info@aureabliss.com</a>. We'll swiftly arrange for a replacement or refund as deemed appropriate. This comprehensive coverage includes protection against loss, damage, or theft during transit.</p>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">Unfortunately, the Standard Shipping and Handling tier does not provide this level of coverage.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Non-returnable Items</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">Due to hygiene concerns and specific supplier agreements, some items cannot be returned:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-bottom: 5px;">e-Gift cards</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-bottom: 5px;">Used items</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-bottom: 5px;">Sale items</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">Please ensure your item is not on this list before initiating a return.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Refunds</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">Upon receipt and inspection of your return, we'll notify you via email regarding the approval or rejection of your refund. Approved refunds will be processed within 7 business days and credited to your original payment method. Note: return shipping costs are non-refundable and will be deducted from your refund.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Late or Missing Refunds</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">If your refund is delayed, please check your bank account, contact your credit card company, and your bank. Processing times may vary. If you've taken these steps and still haven't received your refund, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@aureabliss.com" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: none;">info@aureabliss.com</a>.</p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Sale Items and Gifts</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">Discounted items cannot be refunded. If a product was marked as a gift during purchase and shipped directly to you, you'll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Refunds for items bought as gifts will be provided to the gift giver.</p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">We recommend opting for a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance for items valued over $75. We cannot guarantee the receipt of your returned item.</p>

  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 15px;">Thank you for choosing Aurea Bliss. We're dedicated to ensuring your complete satisfaction.</p>
